## üèõÔ∏è System Architecture

The system is built with a modular design to ensure scalability and ease of expansion.

### Backend
The heart of the system is a Python Flask application. It handles:
* Receiving incoming WhatsApp messages via Twilio webhooks.
* Processing user commands and routing them to appropriate functions.
* Interacting with the MySQL database for data storage and retrieval.
* Scheduling and delivering automated lessons.
* Managing Stripe payments and webhooks.
* Generating certificates dynamically.

### Frontend
A web-based interface provides:
* A public-facing landing page to showcase features and pricing.
* A secure admin dashboard for content creators and administrators to manage users, lessons, and subscriptions.

### Database Schema
The MySQL database is structured to efficiently store and manage all essential data:
* `Users`: User profiles, WhatsApp numbers, subscription status, last active time.
* `Lessons`: Lesson content, categories, sequence.
* `Categories`: Grouping for lessons.
* `Progress Tracking`: Records user's lesson completion, quiz scores, streaks.
* `Subscriptions`: Details of user subscriptions (tier, start/end dates, payment status).
* `Message Logging`: Stores incoming and outgoing messages for analytics and debugging.

## üí¨ WhatsApp Commands

Users can interact with the bot using the following commands:

* `START` - Begin learning journey and receive the first lesson.
* `LESSON` - Get today's scheduled lesson.
* `PROGRESS` - View personal learning statistics and streaks.
* `SUBSCRIBE` - View available subscription plans and pricing.
* `HELP` - Receive assistance and a list of available commands.

## üí∞ Revenue Streams

The platform offers multiple avenues for monetization:

* **Subscription Plans**: Ranging from `$2.99/week` to `$29.99/month`.
* **Certificates**: Selling digital skill certificates upon course completion.
* **Premium Features**: Offering add-ons like 1-on-1 coaching sessions or job placement assistance.
* **Partnership**: Collaborating with training institutes to offer their content or services.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-repo-link/whatsapp-microlearning-coach.git](https://github.com/your-repo-link/whatsapp-microlearning-coach.git)
    cd whatsapp-microlearning-coach
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv WhatsappVenv
    # On Windows:
    .\WhatsappVenv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source WhatsappVenv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Configuration

1.  **Create `.env` file:**
    Copy the example environment file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2.  **Edit `.env` file:**
    Open the newly created `.env` file and add your credentials for Twilio, Stripe, and MySQL.
    (Example content for `.env.example` would typically be provided with the project)

    ```env
    # Twilio Credentials
    TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
    TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER=+1xxxxxxxxxx

    # MySQL Database Credentials
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_USER=your_db_user
    DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
    DB_NAME=whatsapp_learning

    # Stripe Credentials
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

    # Flask App Secret Key
    FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your_flask_secret_key_for_sessions
    ```

### Database Setup

1.  **Run the SQL setup script:**
    This script will create the necessary tables in your MySQL database. Ensure your MySQL server is running and you have configured the `DB_USER` and `DB_PASSWORD` in your `.env` correctly.

    ```bash
    mysql -u your_db_user -p your_db_name < database_setup.sql
    ```
    (You will be prompted for your MySQL password)

2.  **Insert sample lessons and categories (Optional):**
    If your `database_setup.sql` doesn't include sample data, you might have separate scripts or an admin interface to add initial content.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Flask application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The application will typically run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (or another port if configured).

### WhatsApp Webhook Configuration

1.  **Deploy your application:**
    For Twilio to reach your local server, you'll need to deploy your Flask application to a publicly accessible URL (e.g., using Ngrok for local testing, or a cloud provider like Vercel, Heroku, AWS, etc.).

2.  **Configure Twilio Webhook:**
    In your Twilio console, navigate to your WhatsApp-enabled phone number settings.
    Set the "WHEN A MESSAGE COMES IN" webhook URL to:
    `https://yourdomain.com/webhook`
    Replace `yourdomain.com` with the public URL of your deployed application.
